## Pset5

Run `./retrieval` and `./grade_all` as usual. `./questions_grade_all.sh` will show you a student's questions.txt, let you comment on how they did, and then repeat for the rest of the students.

####Differences this week:
- check50 output goes to `check50.txt`,
- valgrind output goes to `valgrind.txt`
- question commentary goes to `check-questions.txt`

If someone's program hangs (i.e. valgrind takes more than like 15 seconds to run) hit `ctrl-\` to stop valgrind and go on to the next person.
