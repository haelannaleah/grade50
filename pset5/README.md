## Pset5

Run `./retrieval` and `./grade_all` as usual. 

####Differences this week:
- check50 output goes to `check50.txt`,
- valgrind output goes to `valgrind.txt`

If someone's program hangs (i.e. valgrind takes more than like 15 seconds to run) hit `ctrl-\` to stop valgrind and go on to the next person.
